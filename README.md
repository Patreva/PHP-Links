# PHP-Links

You must get the name while in file2 as you wrote it in File1.

use of ampersand & in the click2 link leads to break of url because it is received as an array it is brken into keys you can observe this by printing in the browser print_r($_GET);

We avoid this by encoding url in click3 and Using name Positi
